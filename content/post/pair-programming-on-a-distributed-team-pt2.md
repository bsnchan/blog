This blog post is a continuation of my first [pair programming blog post](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/pair-programming-in-a-distributed-team). It has been more than a year since the last post so I wanted to give an update on how we're doing and share some tips that have helped increase the quality of pairing on a distributed team.

As the project count increases at Pivotal, remote pairing has allowed us as a company to leverage team members with different skillsets and technical backgrounds to build a solid, well-rounded team. In addition to those benefits, it helps unify engineers across offices and helps transfers knowledge across timezones.

For the past year or more, I have been able to grow my remote-pairing learnings while pairing on the [Pivotal Cloud Cache](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-marketplace/data-management/pivotal-cloud-cache) team based in Toronto and New York, as well as the [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](https://cloudfoundry.org/container-runtime/) team based in Dublin, Toronto, Portland/Palo Alto. 

Below are just a handful of learned lessons that have made a huge impact for me on the quality of pairing across a distributed team:

### Attend group discussions solo

When a team in the same office has meetings, the default behavior was to book a meeting room for the team to talk in. However, if there was a remote person attending the meeting, the sound quality was always subpar and we found that it was easy to get into situations where the remote person was ignored since the team that was physically together would natually make eye contact with one another when speaking. If we take that situation to the next level where the two halves of a distributed team were based in two separate meeting rooms, we found that one side would end up dominating conversations and it would be difficult for the other side to get a word in. We literally got into situations where we were waving our arms just to interrupt the other half of the group.

We found that simply attending group discussions from our workstations made a huge impact. Although it may seem like such a minor thing to do, the quality of discussions were just much better as everyone speaking was actually able to make eye contact and speak without feeling like they were rudely interrupting one another.

### Use an ambient room

One of the hardest things I found about being on a distributed team is that it is easy to feel like you don't really have a team since they don't physically sit with you.

### Rotate running stand-up and retros

### Take advantage of online tools

#### Parrit

#### Postfacto

#### Realtime Board

#### TeamSpeak

### Meet up in person once in a while

### Give feedback often
