This blog post is a continuation of my first [pair programming blog post](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/pair-programming-in-a-distributed-team). It has been more than a year since the last post so I wanted to give an update on how we're doing!

As the project count increases at Pivotal, remote pairing has allowed us as a company to leverage team members with different skillsets and technical backgrounds to build a solid, well-rounded team. In addition to those benefits, it helps unify engineers across offices and helps transfers knowledge across timezones.

For the past year or more, I have been able to grow my remote-pairing learnings while pairing on the [Pivotal Cloud Cache](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-marketplace/data-management/pivotal-cloud-cache) team based in Toronto and New York, as well as the [Cloud Foundry Container Runtime](https://cloudfoundry.org/container-runtime/) team based in Dublin, Toronto, Portland/Palo Alto. 

Below is just a handful of learned lessons that have made a huge impact for me on the quality of pairing across a distributed team:

### Attend group discussions solo

Attending meetings from conference rooms made team discussions really hard. Due to the layout of large meeting rooms, the sound quality is always subpar and it is easy to get into situations where team members in the same locale end up dominating the conversation.

### Use an ambient room

### Rotate running stand-up and retros

### Take advantage of online tools

#### Parrit

#### Postfacto

#### Realtime Board

#### TeamSpeak

### Give feedback often
